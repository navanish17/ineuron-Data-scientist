    "(i) The difference between the `/` and `//` operators in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/` is the regular division operator and performs floating-point division. It gives the result with decimal places if needed. For example, `10 / 3` would result in `3.3333333333333335`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `//` is the floor division operator. It performs division and rounds down the result to the nearest integer. For example, `10 // 3` would result in `3`.\n",

    "(ii) The difference between the `**` and `^` operators in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `**` is the exponentiation operator. It raises the left operand to the power of the right operand. For example, `2 ** 3` would result in `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `^` is not an exponentiation operator in Python. Instead, it is the bitwise XOR operator. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of the two operands. For example, `5 ^ 3` would result in `6` (binary `101 ^ 011` gives `110`, which is 6 in decimal). If you want to perform exponentiation, use the `**` operator instead."
